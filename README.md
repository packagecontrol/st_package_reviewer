Supports passing local file paths
or URLs to GitHub repositories.

This README focuses on installation and usage of the tool.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.8** or higher.

```bash
$ pip install st-package-reviewer
```


## Usage

```
usage: st_package_reviewer [-h] [--version] [--clip] [--repo-only] [-w] [-v]
                           [--debug]
                           [path_or_URL [path_or_URL ...]]

Check a Sublime Text package for common errors.

positional arguments:
  path_or_URL           URL to the repository or path to the package to be checked. If not provided, runs in interactive mode.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --clip                Copy report to clipboard.
  --repo-only           Do not check the package itself and only its repository.
  -w, --fail-on-warnings
                        Return a non-zero exit code for warnings as well.
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.
  --debug               Enter pdb on exceptions. Implies --verbose.

Return values:
    0: No errors
    -1: Invalid command line arguments

Additional return values in non-interactive mode (a combination of bit flags):
    1: Package check finished with failures
    2: Repository check finished with failures
    4: Unable to download repository

Interactive mode:
    Enter package paths or repository URLS continuously.
    Type `c` to copy the last report to your clipboard.
